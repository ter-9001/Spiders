                Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) em uma excursão visita um laboratório de genética a exposição de aranhas de
                15 espécies junto com seu amigo Harry Osborn (James Franco) e seu interesse amoroso, Mary Jane Watson
                (Kirsten Dunst). Lá, Peter é picado por uma aranha geneticamente modificada. Depois de chegar a casa de
                seu Tio Ben (Cliff Robertson) e sua Tia May (Rosemary Harris), ele acaba inconsciente. Enquanto isso, o
                pai de Harry, o cientista Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), está tentando preservar um contrato militar de
                importância crucial para sua empresa a Oscorp. Ele testa uma fórmula ampliadora de desempenho em si
                mesmo, porém, acaba ficando insano e mata seu assistente, Mendel Stromm (Ron Perkins). Na manhã
                seguinte, Peter descobre que sua visão melhorou, e seu corpo se metamorfoseou em um físico mais
                musculoso. Na escola, ele descobre que pode produzir teias, e ganha um sentido de aranha, que o salva de
                ser esmurrado pelo valentão da escola, Flash Thompson (Joe Manganiello), e termina por mandar o mesmo ao
                chão com um único soco, impressionando seus colegas.

                Jogando fora o conselho de seu tio Ben, de que "com grandes poderes vêm grandes responsabilidades",
                Peter entra em um torneio de luta livre para ganhar dinheiro e comprar um carro, para impressionar Mary
                Jane, adotando o nome de "Aranha Humana", onde o locutor do ringue se engana ao pronunciar, e lhe chama
                de "Homem Aranha". Ele vence a luta diante do adversário de nome "Serra Osso", assim acabando sendo
                enganado. Quando o ladrão Denis Carradine rouba o dinheiro do promotor, Peter deixa o ladrão fugir. Mais
                tarde, ele descobre que seu tio Ben foi assassinado a tiros, possivelmente pelo mesmo assaltante. Peter
                confronta o assaltante, apenas para descobrir que era o mesmo ladrão que ele deixou fugir. Depois de
                Peter desarmá-lo, ele cai de uma janela e morre. Enquanto isso, Norman mata vários cientistas e alguns
                militares do General Slocum.

                Ao se formar, Peter começa a lutar contra o crime, criando um traje e apelidando-se de Homem-Aranha. O
                editor do Clarim Diário, J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons), contrata Peter como fotógrafo, já que Peter
                foi o único que conseguiu fotos claras do Homem-Aranha.

                Norman, ao tomar conhecimento de que os membros do conselho da Oscorp pretendem vender a sua empresa, os
                mata durante o Festival da União Mundial. Jameson nomeia o misterioso assassino de Duende Verde. O
                Duende oferece ao Homem-Aranha um lugar ao seu lado, mas ele recusa o convite. No jantar de Ação de
                Graças, Norman deduz a verdadeira identidade do Homem-Aranha, devido o corte no braço feito por Duende
                Verde. Posteriormente, o Duende Verde ataca e hospitaliza a Tia May.

                Mary Jane admite que ela tem uma queda pelo Homem-Aranha, que a salvou em inúmeras ocasiões, e pergunta
                a Peter se o Homem-Aranha já perguntou sobre ela. Harry, que ama Mary Jane, chega e a vê reunida com
                Peter. Arrasado, Harry diz ao pai que Mary Jane ama Peter, sem querer revelando a maior fraqueza do
                Homem-Aranha.

                O Duende sequestra Mary Jane e um bonde cheio de crianças, e os mantém como reféns ao lado da ponte do
                Queensboro. Ele obriga o Homem-Aranha a escolher quem ele quer salvar, e joga os dois da ponte. O
                Homem-Aranha consegue salvar Mary Jane e o bonde, enquanto o Duende e bombardeado por civis. O duende
                leva o aranha a um esconderijo abandonado, onde eles tem uma última batalha, onde Peter leva uma surra
                do Duende, podendo se redimir depois, descobrindo que era Norman, pai de seu melhor amigo Harry.

                Norman implora perdão a Peter, mas sua personalidade de Duende o incentiva a usar um controle remoto
                para direcionar o planador para Peter. O herói evita o ataque dando um belíssimo pulo, mas o planador
                acaba empalando Norman. Antes de morrer, Norman pede a Peter que não conte a Harry sobre o Duende Verde.
                O Homem-Aranha leva o corpo de Norman a mansão, escondendo os equipamentos do Duende Verde, mas Harry
                acaba chegando e vendo á cena de seu pai, agora falecido. No funeral de Norman, Harry jura vingança
                contra o Homem-Aranha, e afirma que Peter é a única coisa que lhe resta, uma vez que agora é órfão. Mary
                Jane confessa a Peter que é apaixonada por ele, mas ele sente que deve protege-la dos inimigos do
                Homem-Aranha, e esconde seus verdadeiros sentimentos. Enquanto Peter deixa o funeral, ele se recorda das
                palavras de Ben sobre a responsabilidade, e aceita sua vida de Homem-Aranha.

                this version of Peter Parker was born circa 1995 and had lived in New York City since his birth. At a young age, Peter Parker's parents are said to have died in a plane crash, leaving him to be raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Peter attended Midtown Science High School where he was an unpopular student, being bullied by jock Flash Thompson. Whilst on a school field trip he first met Gwen Stacy whom he fell in love with. On that same field trip Peter was bitten by a radioactive spider, which gave him enhanced agility, strength, speed, durability, a spider-sense, and the ability to crawl on walls. He then created web shooters for himself and donned a brand new costume, taking the name "Spider-Man", and chose to protect the city as a superhero for the greater good after the death of his beloved Uncle Ben.

He then met with Dr. Curt Connors, who was an old colleague of his father, and helped him to finish a serum, which Dr. Connors then would later use on himself, transforming him into a monster known as The Lizard. Deeming it to be his fault and responsibility, Peter makes it his duty as Spider-Man to stop the Lizard and save New York City.

Peter fought The Lizard twice, once in the sewers, while Spider-Man was testing out his camera and the Lizard attacked and tried to kill him, because he did not want the citizens of New York to know of his existence and again at Peter's school, after The Lizard found out that Peter was Spider-Man, he battled him through the hallways of the school while students evacuated, when it looked as though the Lizard was going to kill him, Gwen Stacy intervened and attacked The Lizard with a trophy. The Lizard left the school and went back beneath the waters and into the sewers.


Spider-Man versus the Lizard

Atop Oscorp Tower, The Lizard planned to use a reptilian DNA sample to infect the citizens of New York City with. Spider-Man arrived to stop what Connors was doing, but was stopped himself by The Lizard. The two faced off, resulting in the narrowest of victories for Spider-Man. As George Stacy held off The Lizard, Peter climbed to the device The Lizard was using and planned to install the healing DNA that Captain Stacy had given to him. Unfortunately, Stacy was seriously injured by the beast, as it had impaled Stacy in the chest. Spider-Man eventually stopped The Lizard and joined Captain Stacy for his last moments who made him promise to keep Gwen safe by not involving her with his life.

The Amazing Spider-Man 2
"“You know what it is I love about being Spider-Man? Everything!”"
―Spider-Man[src]
Spider-Man is seen in pursuit of criminals carrying a truck full of plutonium (dangerous radioactive chemicals) through the city. Whilst talking to Gwen Stacy on the phone, he sees a vision of her late father, Captain Stacy, and is reminded of the promise he made to stay away from Gwen. During the chase, he saves the life of a man named Max Dillon. Afterwards, Peter meets Gwen at their high school graduation ceremony where the two share a kiss. However, later in the evening, Peter tells Gwen about the visions he's been having and insists that he needs to keep his promise in which Gwen breaks up with Peter.

Upon hearing the news of Harry returning to New York City and the death of Norman Osborn, Peter Parker visits Harry and the two are reunited after ten years. Later that night, Peter meets Gwen in attempt to maintain a friendship, and Gwen tells Peter that an opportunity to Oxford University means she has to move to England. Before the two can discuss it, Max accidentally shuts off the power to Times Square whilst looking for electricity to power himself. Max is seen all over time square where he is actually seen. Spider-Man attempts to calm the situation down. Spider-Man then saves people from his destruction. As Electro is replaced by Spider-Man all over Times Square which Electro then thinks Spider-Man is nothing but selfish. But after the police try to snipe him, Max thinks that Spider-Man has betrayed him, Spider-Man tries to calm him down but fails and Electro, in rage, attacks. Spider-Man eventually stops him and he is taken to Oscorp to be tested on.

Harry begins to show symptoms of his illness and uses the device his father gave him to deduce that Spider-Man's blood could help save him. He asks Peter for help finding him but Peter refuses, unsure of what effects the transfusion would have, fearing another incident like with Connors. Parker visits Harry again, this time as Spider-Man, but again refuses. He then goes to Gwen Stacy and finds her then tells her about the situation and also gives her luck.

Peter uses information left behind by his father to locate the video message Richard left. In it, Richard explains that he had to leave New York because he wasn't willing to go along with Norman Osborn's plans to use what they had created for biological weapons with his research.


Spider-Man versus Electro

Peter then receives a voicemail message from Gwen, telling him that she was offered the job in England and was heading to the airport to fly there earlier than expected because of an earlier class. Peter manages to catch her and professes his love for her, and the two agree to go to England together. They are interrupted by a blackout caused by Electro. Peter takes Gwen down where the police are and Gwen helps him with his web-shooters to go against Electro. Peter heads off to fight with Electro having the upper-hand. As Electro has Spider-Man in the air and is electrocuting him, Gwen comes in a police car and hits Electro, against Peter's demands. The two plan to defeat Electro by overloading his electricity supply.

Just after they do so, Harry Osborn arrives, now as the Green Goblin , and figures out Spider-Man’s identity and that he wants revenge for being refused the life saving blood transfusion. Goblin takes Gwen and drops her where Spider-Man catches her. The two fight at the top of a clock tower, and Spider-Man manages to subdue the Goblin. However, during the fight, Gwen falls and is supported by a web connected to one of the gears. The gears gives way which causes to cut the web, and Gwen again falls. Goblin is then defeated and Peter tries to save Gwen using his web. As Peter webs to catch her, she hits her head on the floor dying instantly from the impact. Peter could only sit and weep in grief after Gwen's death.

Five months pass and Spider-Man is nowhere to be seen in New York, as Peter spends every day at Gwen's grave. Meanwhile, Harry Osborn is visited by an unknown identity who tells him that they have found a man suitable of operating a large suit of armor developed by Oscorp. The man is Alexsei Sytsevich - the criminal stopped by Spider-Man once before. He attacks the city streets in the mech-suit, going by the name The Rhino. Peter is inspired by a recording of Gwen's graduation speech and makes his return as Spider-Man to fight Rhino.

Post-The Amazing Spider-Man 2
After the death of Gwen Stacy, Peter struggled to move on and keep going as he started to inhabit violent qualities in his Spider-Man persona by not pulling back his punches and becoming more rageful as time went on.

Spider-Man: No Way Home
When an alternate Peter Parker botched the spell that Doctor Strange casted, Peter was transported to another universe, along with two of his foes he fought in the past.

Spider-Man got mainly involved when Ned was trying to find his Peter by using a Sling Ring in opening a portal. However, the portal opened at Spider-Man's location, with Ned and MJ calling him and made him go through the portal. Realizing he was not the Peter they were expecting, Ned's grandmother panicked while Ned and MJ confused. He removed his mask before telling Ned's grandmather that it is okay. MJ asked who he is, then introduced himself as a Spider-Man in a different world and confused as he was teleported to their universe. As he was mentioning about the String Theory, Multi-Dimensional reality, and Matter Displacement being real, Ned whispered to MJ that the reason for Spider-Man's situation is because of the spell. With Peter overhearing it, he chats with Ned a bit about magic being real but MJ halts the conversation. MJ asks to prove him that he is Peter Parker, but Peter answers by saying he doesn't have an I.D, since it kind of defeats the purpose of the anonymous superhero-thing. MJ throws a bread at him, while doing a fighting pose with Ned. Peter asks why did she do that. She said that it's for checking if he has the "tingle" thing for proof. As MJ is about to throw another bread, Peter said that not to throw it again and remarks her deeply mistrusting approach and respects it. After saying so, he sticked to the ceiling by one hand. MJ tells him to crawl around and Peter replies that why does he need to. MJ said that it's not enough and Peter says that it's plenty. Ned's grandmother requests in annoyance to Ned for Peter to put away the dust at the corners of the ceiling in Tagalog. Ned translates it for Peter then it finally made him crawl and put away the dust, with Ned's grandmother thanking him.
